h1. DroidDice2

DroidDice2 is a dice rolling application for Android devices. Features include:

* Multiple die types (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20)
* Exploding dice (as in Savage Worlds
* Save commonly used sets  of dice

I wrote DroidDice2 as a demonstration project to see how effectively Scala could be used as a programming language for
Android projects. It is based on my java project, DroidDice:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.droiddice&hl=en,
but updates the user interface to take advantage of some of the new features of Android 4.0.

h2. Compiling

DroidDice2 was developed with eclispe, and uses the standard ADK tooling. I generally compile using the command line
with Ant.
